By Abigail Moyo Frustrated South Africans, numb in the face of the mounting pressures of load-shedding, water outages, unemployment, escalating food and fuel costs, and a general lack of service delivery, are grimly waiting to see whether Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana will come up with interventions to counter these daily challenges. Can he produce an appropriate and sustainable budget that will be economically liberating? Or will it be the usual callouts, panels, commissions, and new roles for old friends? Earlier this month, President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s State of the Nation address made it painfully clear that no proper action plan had been carved out. Ahead of the tabling of the National Budget tomorrow, UASA calls on Godongwana to present a sustainable budget speech that will lift South Africans out of this national depression and will give them solid reasons to hope for something better to come. UASA demands: The economic and social inequality that most South Africans have been reduced to is humiliating after so much trust and faith in our leaders to be transparent, lawful, and accountable was demonstrated. Godongwana, be the solution that your people need. Abigail Moyo is the spokesperson of the trade union UASA. BUSINESS REPORT
