Amazing Video Footage Shows Two Sumatran Tiger Cubs Being Born At Chester Zoo. Hidden cameras have captured a first glimpse of two endangered Sumatran tiger cubs born at Chester Zoo on 7 January 2023. The tiny twins were born to first-time parents Kasarna and Dash - and the new family has since been bonding in their den with all of their adorable early life antics caught by the zoo’s CCTV cameras.  Zookeepers say the new arrivals are yet to be sexed and will be named once they start to gain in confidence and venture outside, which experts estimate will be in early April. Just 350 Sumatran tigers are thought to remain in the wild – making them one of the world’s rarest tiger subspecies. They are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) - the most severe conservation category and highest priority.  According to carnivore experts, the birth is a significant step forward for the conservation breeding programme working to save the species from extinction.  Dave Hall, Carnivore Team Manager at Chester Zoo, said: “We’ve been closely monitoring Kasarna on our CCTV cameras as she gets to grips with motherhood and her first litter of cubs, it’s a real privilege and incredibly special to watch. She’s a great mum and is being very attentive to her new infants, keeping them snuggled up in the den and feeding them every few hours”.  The expansion of unsustainable palm oil and coffee plantations has seen more than 90 per cent of the Sumatran tigers’ habitat wiped out. The species is also heavily poached for its skin, bones and canine teeth, which are sold illegally on the traditional Asian medicine markets. This makes Kasarna’s two cubs are absolutely crucial to the survival of the species.
