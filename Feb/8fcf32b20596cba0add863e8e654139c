With the current high cost of living in South Africa, consumers will be deal-hunting this Valentine‚Äôs Day, while still trying to spoil their loved ones.  Many will be looking to make a move on their long-time crush, or just simply flourish in the romance of the day with their partners.  Businesses, however, will be looking to capitalise as Valentine‚Äôs Day is the next big commercial shopping event following Black Friday and the festive period.  Many businesses are looking to attract love-struck consumers to their stores, especially after the South African Reserve Bank hiked interest rates late in January and the petrol price increase in February, not to mention the rolling blackouts imposed by ailing state-owned power utility, Eskom. Many consumers will be looking for deals and specials when it comes to their wallets and spending.  Business Report  spotted a few deals that some of the more popular stores and restaurants in the country will be running for Valentine‚Äôs Day.
