The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has taken further steps against retirement fund administrator N-e-F-G Administrators of Vanderbijlpark, following the appointment of Krishen Sukdev as statutory manager in May last year. However, it says about half a billion rands of retirement fund assets are unaccounted for or “unrealisable”. In an report released on Friday on progress sorting out the affairs of the troubled company, the FSCA says it withdrew N-e-F-G’s license as a financial services provider on 22 December 2021, after the entity went into business rescue owing to financial distress. It says the statutory manager has provided reports, which have established the following: The FSCA says it has considered the reports by the statutory manager in a serious light, and has undertaken the following steps: As part of its regulatory oversight, the FSCA is in constant contact with the statutory manager to assess developments. The statutory manager is available to engage with concerned members of the public and has recently, together with the FSCA, met with a group of affected persons and provided them with details of a criminal case opened against N-e-FG Administrators and/or its management by Lion Insurance Company, with the South African Police Services.
