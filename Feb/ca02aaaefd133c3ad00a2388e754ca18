The number of layoffs skyrocketed in November, the worst month in 2022.  Statistics show that tech companies let go nearly 52,400 members of their staff in that month alone, or one-third of all job cuts reported last year.

Microsoft saw the second-largest layoff in 2023, with 10,000 reported job cuts. Amazon and Salesforce followed with 8,000.
