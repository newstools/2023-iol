The case against a woman police officer accused of raping and sexually grooming her son was postponed to February 16 and 17. The case was reprimanded for the State to verify the woman's address, should the court grant her bail, Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) spokesperson, Lizzy Suping, said.  The boy is believed to have been around 10-years-old at the time the incident was recorded. In a clip of the incident, which has gone viral, the woman can be seen lying naked on a bed. The camera then shows a young boy, also naked, holding the woman’s thighs. According to a translation, the woman tells the boy to get on top of her and continues to encourage the boy, despite him telling her that he does not know how to do it. Provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said that the woman’s identity would not be revealed to protect that of the boy, who has since been moved to a place of safety. Mojapelo said internal police processes have already kicked in following her arrest and will run parallel with the criminal investigation that has been taken over by the Ipid. Limpopo SAPS Commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe added that the actions of this woman are deplorable and deserve harsh condemnation. "Even though the suspect allegedly committed this crime when she was still a Public Service Act employee of the SAPS, she should have known better that such unbecoming behaviour deserved harsh consequences,” Hadebe said. “The South African Police Service does not have the space for such people who tarnish its image.” IOL
