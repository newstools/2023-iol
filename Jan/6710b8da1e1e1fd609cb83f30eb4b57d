The Advertising Regulatory Board (ARB) has added a new clause which deals with cryptocurrency products, to the Code of Advertising Practice. The new rules are aimed at protecting consumers from being misled by unethical advertisers and are the result of consultation and agreement with the cryptocurrency industry. “This is a wonderful example of an industry that sees the harm that could be done in its name, and steps up to self-regulate the issues without being forced to do so by government,” says Gail Schimmel, CEO of the ARB.  “This has been an exciting project and we know that it will result in better protection for vulnerable consumers.” “Rules around ethical advertising are non-negotiable for us as an industry,” says Marius Reitz, GM for Africa at Luno, who has spear-headed the project.  “We don’t want rogue advertisers making claims that mislead vulnerable consumers about the reality of crypto investment. It is important to us that consumers enter this exciting market with their eyes open and their expectations realistic.” The new clause is clause 17 of Section III, and the full text follows: The wording should be, or should communicate the same, as the following example: Investing in crypto assets may result in the loss of capital.
