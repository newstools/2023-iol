This month, Fort Hare University vice-chancellor professor  Sakhela Buhlungu’s executive bodyguard was shot dead in a hail of bullets. Police said  the 52-year-old driver, Mboneli Vesele, was arriving at the home of the vice-chancellor, when an unknown vehicle with unidentified occupants approached. The “Cape Times” reported that Buhlungu’s vision of a clean governance through clamping down on entrenched corruption and fraud at the embattled institution was believed to be one of the reasons for the incident.
