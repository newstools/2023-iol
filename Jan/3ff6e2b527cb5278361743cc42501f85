Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said residents contacted police after discovering a bullet-riddled VW Polo parked at the side of the road. “On arrival at the crime scene, they observed that there was a silver Polo motor vehicle with registration no FKH 782 MP which was riddled with bullets next to the road. Next to the vehicle were two bodies, the third body was lying inside the car on the driver's seat,” Kinana said. Police are investigating.
