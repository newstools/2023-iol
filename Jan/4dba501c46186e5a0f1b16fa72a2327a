Rustenburg - Five people were killed in two separate road accidents in North West on Saturday. The Department of Public Safety and Road Management said two people died in an accident on the N4 near Rustenburg in the early hours of Saturday when a bakkie collided head-on with a truck. "It is alleged that the 25-year-old male driver of the bakkie, who is deceased, was facing an oncoming traffic driving westwards towards Rustenburg. "The bakkie collided with a truck coming in the opposite direction, caught fire and was completely gutted.
