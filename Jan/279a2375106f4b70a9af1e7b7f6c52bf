Brett Botten, the chief executive officer of South Africa’s SPAR Group, will retire from the grocery retailer and wholesaler on Jan. 31 after close to two years at the helm, the company said on Tuesday. The retirement of Botten, 57, comes as the company faces allegations from independent retailers who use the SPAR brand that it engaged in “fictitious” and “fraudulent” loans, as well as racial bias. In December, SPAR denied the financial allegations were symptomatic of “dodgy” accounting or that it discriminated against some of its retailers based on race or store location. SPAR did not give a reason for Botten’s retirement as it also announced other board changes.  Reuters
