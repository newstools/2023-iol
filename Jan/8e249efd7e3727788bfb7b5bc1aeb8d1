This supposedly includes â€˜personal turnaround, financial turnaround, spiritual turnaround and turnaround in relationships.â€™ The founder of the Crown Gospel Music Awards claimed on the website for webinars of the service that she can change your mindset and your wealth story before the end of this year if you know, deep down, that you are not where you are supposed to be. â€˜â€™I know that you have been working hard, I know that you really want to succeed. But sometimes you feel like you are not good enough, the confidence is not there. â€˜â€™Sometimes you look at other people that are less gifted and less educated than you doing so much better. You know what, sometimes they have somebody guiding them behind the scenes. You need a coach, you need a mentor, tare is where I come in,â€™â€™ she said on Instagram.
