Johannesburg – Amid the city’s crumbling roads and infrastructure, the newly elected City of Joburg mayor, Al-Jama-ah’s Thapelo Amad, says in his 100 days he is looking at fixing potholes as a matter of priority. Amad was last week elected as the new Joburg mayor, having been backed by the ANC, EFF, PA and Cope for the top position, which he is expected to stay in for no more than six months.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. He is expected to be replaced by the ANC’s Dada Morero, once the ANC and EFF reach consensus in a complicated coalition agreement which could see the parties enter into a power sharing deal with the Gauteng metros.  The DA’s Mpho Phalatse was removed as mayor after a motion of no confidence last week. Speaking to Newzroom Afrika at the weekend, Amad said the city was looking at fixing at potholes and identifying systems that could assist in identifying those potholes. “Remember we are now in a digital era and the technology has advanced so much that there is technology that you can use and it will deploy the data to the person who allocates or deploys the human resources to fill up those potholes. “So that can be achievable and I believe so, within the period of 100 days,” he said. The Joburg Roads Agency is responsible for potholes on municipal roads, while the city also has also an active partnership with Discovery and Dial Direct’s Pothole Patrol, which has seen over tens of thousands of potholes repaired around the city. Amad has also maintained that Phalatse’s legacy in the city was about the collapse of the city’s finances.  Amad added, however, that if her plans to combat load shedding were feasible it was something they could look into.  He said if Phalatse had put any plans in place they would continue with those plans because they were meant for the residents of the City of Joburg and not individuals. However, many on Twitter were not impressed with Amad and they did not waste time in sharing their views. “Hhaybo!

Seriously is that what @AbubakrThapelo wants to achieve for the continent's economic hub, the most dense city in our country, a city beset by failing infrastructure, burgeoning costs, economic decay, massive unemployment and poverty, challenges of climate change?” @Maggs Naidu asked.
