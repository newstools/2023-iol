Washington - A SWAT team has breached a white van linked to the mass shooting in California and found a body inside, ABC News reports. Earlier on Sunday, US media reported that two vehicles of the US special services had surrounded a white van, which possibly contained the suspect in the Monterey Park shooting that left 10 people killed and 10 others injured. According to ABC, a body could be seen in the driver’s seat of the van involved in the police stand-off that lasted for more than two hours on Sunday. According to US media reports, the man involved in the stand-off might have shot himself. The stand-off occurred at the intersection of Hawthorne and Sepulveda in the city of Torrance, California. The white van is reportedly linked to a separate incident in the neighbouring city of Alhambra, where a gunman, presumably the same suspect, was disarmed by bystanders at a ballroom and then fled the scene in the vehicle, according to ABC. “The suspect walked in there, probably with the intent to kill more people, and two brave community members decided they were going to jump into action and disarm him,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said, as quoted by USA Today. No injuries were reported following the Alhambra incident, which occurred about 20 to 30 minutes after the Monterey Park shooting. A weapon was discovered at the scene, police said, adding that it could be the same firearm used in Monterey Park. Later, Luna noted that the police found a semi-automatic magazine-fed assault pistol with an attached high-capacity magazine. Late on Saturday, January 21, a gunman opened fire at a local dance studio in the city of Monterey Park, east of Los Angeles, killing 10 people and injuring 10 others. He then fled the scene. The incident occurred at the end of the first day of a two-day street festival to celebrate Lunar New Year. The City of Monterey Park cancelled the rest of the Chinese New Year celebrations following the mass shooting. Sputnik
