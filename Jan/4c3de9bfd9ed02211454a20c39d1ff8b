Pretoria - The Limpopo department of sport, arts and culture has congratulated reigning Miss South Africa Ndavi Nokeri for flying South Africa’s flag high with an outstanding showing at the 71st Miss Universe pageant held in New Orleans, United States. “Although Miss South Africa did not win the 2023 Miss Universe pageant, she finished at the top 16, making South Africa, in particular, Limpopo proud of such a feat,” said Limpopo MEC for Sport, Arts and Culture, Nakedi Kekana. In a statement after Miss Universe 2023 was won by Miss USA on Sunday, Kekana said Ndavi remains South Africa’s pride and a shining ambassador. “Reaching the top 16 of this world pageant is not a small achievement by any chance. You could see she held her head and the South African flag high on that stage, illustrated with not less than 87 beauties from across the globe,” said Kekana. Ndavi, who hails from Gavaza village near Tzaneen in Limpopo, is the third Miss Limpopo to wear the Miss South Africa crown in a period of six years. Immediately after her crowning as Miss South Africa, the Limpopo province welcomed her with a mega ceremony in Polokwane and at her village home over a period of two days.
