Eastern Cape police found the suitcase dumped at Phahlane Street, Newvale on Sunday morning at about 10am. “Police were summoned to the scene and on arrival they found the body in a suitcase in a stream,” said police spokesperson Captain Namhla Mdleleni.  “Upon investigation it was revealed that the deceased was reported as missing person on January 14.”  Mdleleni said one person has been arrested and charged with murder.  "The suspect will appear in the Komani Magistrate’s Court soon.“ In another incident, a 23-year-old municipal sub-contractor was killed while unblocking a drain in Missionvale in the Eastern Cape.  According to police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu: “It is alleged two sub-contractors were busy inside a drain in GG Grounds in Missionvale when a blockage gave way and the drain started to flow.  “The strong suction pulled both workers into the pipe underneath the water.  “Rescue workers from the SAPS and the Fire department managed to recover both victims. They were resuscitated and rushed to hospital.”  The next day one person died while the other remained critical in hospital.  “The men were sub-contractors for the municipality and were busy unblocking a main raw sewage service drain when the incident  occurred,” Naidu said.  She said an inquest docket had been opened for further investigation.  IOL
