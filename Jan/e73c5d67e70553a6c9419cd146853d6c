UIF Commissioner, Teboho Maruping, says the Fund remained committed to providing social security to UIF contributors and their beneficiaries, in line with Section 27 (1) (c) of the Constitution, which stated: “everyone has the right to social security". “I am very pleased that we were able to disburse the R1 billion to so many of our clients during the busy December period, and I have no doubt that this R1 billion payout in benefits went a long way towards helping our clients to put food on the table during the festive break and planning for crucial items such as purchasing stationery and uniforms for children at the beginning of the new year as schools reopened around the country," he said. Maruping said this year, the Fund would redouble its efforts to improve service delivery and continue paying out claims to qualifying clients and their beneficiaries as efficiently as possible. "We will also be enhancing our Information and Communications Technology systems and launching a data-free mobile Application (APP), a free USSD system, and a few other platforms to bolster and improve service delivery to our clients and stakeholders. Further announcements of these developments will be made in due course,” said Maruping. BUSINESS REPORT
