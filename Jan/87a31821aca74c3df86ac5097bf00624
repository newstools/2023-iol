Welcome To  the Personal Finance’s Podcast show with me Content Editor Ruan Jooste. This is our January Pension Plain episode and the first for the year, where  we cover retirement everything, everyone, and everywhere. Last year we covered Pension Fund reform, and the tax implications thereof, and spoke to the Pension fund Adjudicator on her office’s annual report, and today we will be talking about pension funds in distress, and the two methods - curatorships and statutory management - available to the pension fund regulator -  the Financial Sector Conduct Authority or FSCA for short to get such retirement schemes back on their feet. This and our previous recordings are available on all major podcasts platforms, such as Google and Apple Podcasts and Spotify, to name a few.  You can also find it on Anchor, and on the IOL website, under the Personal Finance section. My two guests today are Cornelia Buitendag,  head of conduct supervision at the FSCA and Wilmi van der Walt - manager of retirement funds conduct supervision.
