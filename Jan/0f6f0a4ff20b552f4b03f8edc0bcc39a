Cape Town - A woman was killed after being struck by a train on Saturday morning at Heathfield station in Cape Town.  There was a light police presence at the station and police have cordoned off the vicinity. According to Pastor Charles White of the Eternal Flame church, who was on the scene, the incident happened at 7.15am. The victim was fondly known by the community as Edith.  “She was rushing to Newlands to sell her feather dusters and brooms when she was hit by a train. She supported her family with the proceeds,” said the pastor, adding that she was partially blind and alleged that the state hospital kept postponing her operation. According to community members, the broken fence is to blame for the tragic incident. “We have been asking Prasa for years to repair the fence along the track. We have all the correspondence. Each year they promise it will be done and the budget will be allocated,” said  White, adding that the incident was “tragic and unnecessary”. IOL
