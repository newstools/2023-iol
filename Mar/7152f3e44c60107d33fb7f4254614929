Meanwhile, provincial commissioner of police in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, has commended the police officers who arrested the suspects. “As we continue the fight against gender-based violence, speedy arrests of perpetrators will send a message that the police are determined to relentlessly deal with this scourge,” said Hadebe. The arrested man and woman are this morning expected to appear before the Giyani Magistrate’s Court on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping and murder. IOL
