Teaching in high school, particularly in matric, is not for the faint of heart. This grade is very important in determining a student's future and career. It requires a certain kind of educator to prepare pupils, not only for university, but also for the rest of their adult lives. Instructors in this grade recognise the significance of training future physicians, attorneys, journalists, legislators, and other professionals. Some teachers are so committed to this difficult profession that they even give late and weekend lessons to guarantee that students are prepared for their tests. Samkelo Mhlophe, a life sciences teacher has found a way to bring joy and play into the serious subject to ensure that his students understand. Mhlophe shared the clip of one of his classes, where he was teaching pupils about the development of an embryo on TikTok and it went viral. With over 1.4 million views, students and even teachers from other schools have applauded Mhlophe for the creativity he has in his classes. The innovative teacher believes in teaching students in a language that they understand and what could be better than music? Matric students can be heard singing along to the steps as Mhlophe breaks down this complicated human reproductive process. His video has been shared widely with the educator encouraging his audience to share the video so that other Grade 12 students can better understand if they were having trouble learning the subject. In three parts, the teacher makes the subject that some students may struggle with, look easy. IOL Business
