Rustenburg - Veteran radio personality Mark Pilgrim died at home on Sunday, Hot 102.7FM said. “It is with great sadness that I share this news, that our brother and hero and much-loved radio personality lost his battle with cancer this morning. He fought valiantly to the very end. Mark passed peacefully with his fiancé Adrienne at home. “They were together for his last breath. His family thank you for being part of his journey, for loving him, celebrating him and supporting him always,” managing director, Lloyd Madurai, said in a statement. Pilgrim was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, which he later revealed had spread to his femur, the base of his spine and lymph nodes. He was first diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1988. After surgery and months-long chemotherapy he was declared in remission.  At the start of 2022, Pilgrim confirmed his cancer had returned. He started his radio career on campus radio in the 80s. He also worked for 5FM, 94.7 Highveld Stereo in Joburg. He retired from radio at the end of June in 2014, but made a comeback several months later on the all new Hot 91.9FM in Joburg, initially just doing a Saturday morning show 9am – noon, but eventually coming back to radio full time and also doing Monday to Friday 9am – noon.
