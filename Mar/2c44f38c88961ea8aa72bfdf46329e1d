South Africa’s apex court has given President Cyril Ramaphosa a bloody nose in his challenge to be granted direct access to it regarding the case of the multimillion-rand theft at his game farm, Phalala Phalala. On Wednesday, the Constitutional Court denied Ramaphosa direct access to challenge the findings of retired Chief Justice Sandile Ngcobo who found that he had a case to answer over how he handled the break-in at his game farm. Ngcobo recommended that Ramaphosa face impeachment over the debacle, but the president disputed the findings, and instead filed an application to challenge the Ngcobo report directly with the Constitutional Court. It came after allegations by former spy boss Arthur Fraser that the president had millions of dollars stored in a couch at the farm and was complicit in a high-level law enforcement “cover-up”. In his challenge to the court, Ramaphosa argued that only the Constitutional Court could decide whether he had violated his constitutional obligations. The Constitutional Court, however, unanimously dismissed Ramaphosa’s application, ruling that “no case has been made for exclusive jurisdiction or direct access”.
